:term:`Particl Marketplace` is a platform that lets you buy and sell goods and services online privately, with no middle man. There is no centralized entity operating, controlling, or benefiting from the marketplace.

Unlike Amazon and other traditional marketplace platforms, Particl Marketplace and the PART privacy coin are built with security and privacy principles at their core, which empowers buyers and sellers to keep their identity and data safe at all times.

The Particl project aims to make available advanced and intuitive blockchain technology, to empower individuals to accomplish transactions online privately and with no middleman - to the benefit of their communities and to the detriment of the centralized entities that prey on them.


**The world has changed, so you change as well to brace up your liberty and future.**

* :ref:`Protect your finances <Protect Your Finances>` and keep extra money for what matters in your life. 
* :ref:`Stand for liberty <Stand For Liberty>` and stop being the exploited product.
* :ref:`Squash the rogues <Squash The Rogues>` and stop the scammers.
* :ref:`Contribute to your community <Contribute To Your Communities>` when you buy and sell online.


.. note:: 
	 Particl Marketplace relies on open-source technologies openly audited, inspected, and improved by a global community. It is based on distributed ledger and peer-to-peer technologies. It runs on a network of independent nodes hosted by volunteers scattered across the world. The entirely autonomous platform doesn’t require any central party to operate or maintain, which means no company or organization is between buyers and sellers.

Protect Your Finances
---------------------

Protecting our assets is a natural desire – our powers freedoms are mainly bound to the state of our finances. Unfortunately, if you use “free” internet services, they are not really free! No, instead, you pay with your invaluable personal information and data, on top of commissions and fees.

:term:`Particl Marketplace` does not seek revenues from selling your data, or even through fees. It doesn’t need that data and income because there is no corporate interest behind it. Instead, the people working on Particl are supported entirely by community donations, without any strings attached or compromise for you. This brings down the total cost of doing online commerce.

*“We empower you to maintain your privacy while saving on fees, by cutting out the middleman.“*

----

Stand For Liberty
-----------------

Big corporations collect data from you with every purchase and sale you make - they even do it the second you land on their website and start browsing. They use your data to analyze your behaviors as an online merchant or a consumer and increase their own bottom line. Then, they sell your personal information or use it against you without your knowledge or consent. We have largely become the product, and these corporations are the insidious thieves.
 
**Corporations like e-commerce giants have become your credit score broker.**

The ever-sprawling giant e-commerce corporations always seek to expand their profits, market power, and control. They have substantially contributed to today’s alarming digital security and privacy crisis under the guise of usability and convenience. Now more than ever, protecting your data means protecting your freedom.

*“We empower you to become the captain of your data and liberties.“*

----

Squash The Rogues
-----------------

**You Stop Privacy Invasions and Backdoors** 

No more stolen credit card information or passwords, compromised online accounts, or any online surveillance. When no data about you is created, it cannot be collected by anyone. And when no one collects it, it cannot be shared, sold, misused, hacked, or leaked anymore. That’s true for sellers and buyers regardless, whether it relates to your products, locations, payments, shipping information, preferences, or any online activity. As a result, you can now defend your human right to privacy and shield yourself from the many technical and political uncertainties of today’s world.

*“We help you become invincible to privacy contingencies.”*

**You Stop Restrictions, Politics, and Malice**

:term:`Particl Marketplace` has a 100% uptime that is impossible to be taken offline or manipulated. No merchant, buyer, or product can be banned, censored, or canceled by all-powerful tech overlords. Instead, it's the Particl community that is in charge of what content is allowed or not on the marketplace. Across national borders, you can now enjoy free trade and free-market conditions without the interference of governing bodies or unfair legislation. Manufacturers, vendors, and producers can freely decide how and with whom they do business.

*“We give you access to a true, decentralized free market.”*

**You Stop Fraud and Trickery**

No more false advertising or bad quality counterfeit goods for you as a customer. No more chargebacks for vendors due to stolen identities. Fraudulent attempts get taken down with a free and automated two-party escrow system.

*“We offer you private and efficient solutions to online fraud and scammers.”*

**You Stop Spam and Unwanted Solicitations**

Tailored ads are hammering on you even after making a purchase, and most of the time, before you make it. You see them on the websites you visit, you encounter them throughout your emails, and directly on the apps you use. It even affects how search engines deliver results to you. Invasive ads follow you wherever you go, and, every day, learn more about your habits.

*“We help you to put an end to spam.”*

Contribute To Your Communities
------------------------------

E-commerce and online marketplaces have made the world of shopping and selling a very different place. The price wars destroyed small merchants, only to benefit online platform operators and financial services providers. As a result, small businesses have had to give up, while only a handful of large corporations continuing to dominate the market. The ones who suffer the most are the low-to-middle-class people, the heart of every nation throughout the world.

**Pledge to Small Merchants, Manufacturers, and Producers**

Breaking the online monopolies gives merchants, manufacturers, and producers of goods and services the ability to build a livelihood that no longer depends on middlemen and large corporations' interests.

**Pledge to Local Shops and Co-operatives**

Local shops and co-operatives in your proximity get the ability to set up their own internet shops at virtually no cost, with no maintenance requirement, and without any external interference or oversight.

**Pledge to Yourself and your Communities**

Some say that sustainability and responsibility are the cornerstones of a healthy economy. Don’t wait for somebody to make your economy better! Be your own revolution and liberation. Share and discuss :term:`Particl Marketplace` with your communities and help them improve their situation.

*“Particl marketplace gives you the liberty to level the playing field, and crush competitive disadvantages.”*
